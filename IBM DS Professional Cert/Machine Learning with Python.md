# Machine Learning with Python
## Week 1

What is Machine Learning?

- Subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed"
- coined by Arthur Samuel, 1959 IBM

<br>

## **Major Machine Learning Techniques**
1. Regression
    - Predicting continuous values

    <br>

2. Classification
    - Predicting item class/category of a case

    <br>

3. Clustering
    - Finding structure of data; summarization

    <br>

4. Associations
    - Assoicating frequent co-occurring items/events
    <br>

5. Anomaly Detection
    - Discover abnormal and unusual cases

    <br>
    
6. Sequence Mining
    - Predicting next events; click-streams [Markov Model, HMM]

    <br>
    
7. Dimension Reduction
    - Reducing the size of data (PCA)

    <br>

8. Recommendation Systems
    - Recommending items

## Python Libraries for Machine Learning

**Numpy**: arrays, dictionaries, functions, datatypes, images.

**SciPy**: signal processing, optimization, statistics.

**Matplotlib**: 2D& 3D visualizations.

**Pandas**: import/export data manipulation.

**Scikit-Learn**: Machine Learning libraries.
- classification, regression, clustering algorithms
- most steps are already complete in scikit-learn

## Supervised Learning
"Teach the model"
Controlled environment


### Two types
*Classification*: process of predicting class labels/categories.

*Regression*: proces of preducting continuous values.

## Unsupervised Learning
Model works on its own to discover information
Less controlled environment

### Techniques:
  - Dimension Reduction
  - Density Equation
  - Market Basket Analysis
  - Clustering (most popular): grouping of data points or objects that are somehow similar
    - discovering structure
    - summarization
    - anamoly detection
